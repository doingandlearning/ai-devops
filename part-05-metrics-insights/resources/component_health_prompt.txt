# Component Health Analysis Prompt Template
# Use this with Copilot Chat or LLM API

Analyze component health from the following data:

Components and their metrics:
{component_data}

For each component, provide:
1. Health score (0-100)
   - Calculate based on: issue count, resolution time, build failures, security issues
   - Formula: Start at 100, subtract points for each issue
   - Issue count: -5 per issue (max -50)
   - Resolution time: -1 per day over 3 days (max -20)
   - Build failures: -10 per failure (max -20)
   - Security issues: -15 per issue (max -30)

2. Health status (Healthy/At Risk/Unhealthy)
   - Healthy: Score 80-100
   - At Risk: Score 50-79
   - Unhealthy: Score 0-49

3. Top 3 concerns
   - List the most critical issues affecting this component

4. Recommended actions
   - Specific, actionable steps to improve health

Format as a dashboard-ready summary with:
- Component name
- Health score and status
- Key metrics (issues, resolution time, failures)
- Concerns and actions

Example output format:
```
Component: telemetry
Health Score: 65/100 (At Risk)
Metrics:
  - Issues: 8
  - Avg resolution: 5 days
  - Build failures: 2
  - Security issues: 1
Top Concerns:
  1. High issue count (8 issues in 30 days)
  2. Slow resolution time (5 days average)
  3. Security vulnerability present
Recommended Actions:
  1. Prioritize security fix (P0)
  2. Reduce resolution time target to 3 days
  3. Review component architecture for stability
```
