Belated ticket for this repo and change 109246
Here is a quick summary:
• All files to have Apache headers. We use Apache for contributions, not BSD.
• The usual LICENSE/NOTICE/COPYING/CONTRIBUTING should be present. I would prefer just the Apache-license as we use it, not the extra header text.
• NOTICE should be for QK with credits for anyone else as two-liners (Cisco, RDK)
• Two code matches, both OK but please mod file wifi_hal.c:72 to omit the line numbers as it becomes very specific and impossible to maintain. i.e. "Adapted from ieee80211…." is sufficient.
• NOTICE will then need a two liner "Copyright 2003-2005 Sam Leffler…/Licensed under the BSD-3 License". Add a copy of the BSD-3 License to the end of LICENSE. (Use YEAR and COPYRIGHT HOLDER not exact name and year, so this is useful if there are other BSD-3 bits in the future.)

Checked rdkb-2024q3-kirkstone-ipq_13.0 – OK
rdkb-2024q1-dunfell is missing some license changes (LICENSE/NOTICE)
Recheck: hal-qcawifi/source/hal-qcawifi/wifi_hal.c in the rdkb-2024q1-dunfell branch doesn't have the offending code so this is not a problem after all.
Resolving the ticket.

Rescanned as 117157.  Generally 15-May-25 findings are OK but:
Please add a second credit in wifi_hal.c before 18773 (callback_dump):

Scanned on 15-May (rdkb-2024q1-dunfell, 4a1f967880aaa068862e49deb2161bbc60e293ce)
• NOTICE is not quite the RDK standard. Is it possible to use the standard version used throughout RDK? In particular, to replace line 2 with:
"The component is licensed to you under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License")."
• LICENSE in RDK repos conventionally contains license texts only. Can lines 1-3 be removed?
• Please merge https://code.rdkcentral.com/r/c/rdkb/devices/hal/+/114667

For this repo, is this the complete report that they have address for open sourcing it?
I still see some files missing and I asked them to check and update
If you are expecting a detailed scan please do so
 
Thanks
